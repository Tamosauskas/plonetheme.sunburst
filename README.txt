Sunburst, a theme for Plone 4
=============================

Sunburst is a modern, minimalist, grid-based, HTML5 theme for Plone 4.

Goals:
- Keep the theme color-neutral (black, white, grays), so it meshes with any company logo and doesn't feel like it requires color adjustment for doing the 10-minute-show-it-to-the-boss exercise.
- The theme doesn't use tables for layout, and is based on the Deco grid approach which is currently in use on plone.org. It works perfectly in all browsers, including IE6.
- The grid works in both fixed-width and flexible-width modes, we may optionally include a switch for this if we think it's a common operation.
- No substantial markup changes outside of the table removal and new HTML5 elements â€” class and ID names are kept.
- The theme uses some CSS3 features, but degrades gracefully.
- The theme does not use any DTML.
